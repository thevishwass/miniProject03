# Data Visualization Project (2020-2025 Dataset)

This project explores and visualizes data from the `2020-2025.csv` dataset using Python libraries such as **pandas**, **seaborn**, and **matplotlib**. The purpose is to create meaningful graphs (bar plots, line plots, KDE plots, etc.) and analyze trends and distributions across countries and years.

## 📖 Dataset Description

The dataset contains data for multiple countries spanning the years 2020 to 2025. It includes the following columns:

- **Country** – Name of the country
- **2020**, **2021**, **2022**, **2023**, **2024**, **2025** – Numeric data corresponding to each year

The dataset is used to analyze trends, compare values between countries, and understand distributions.

## 📊 Graphs and Insights

### Example Graphs Included:

1. **Bar Plot** – Compare data by country for a specific year (e.g., 2023)
2. **Line Plot** – Show trends over time for a selected country (e.g., Albania)
3. **KDE Plot** – Visualize the distribution of values for a year
4. **Box Plot** – Identify outliers and distribution spread in a dataset

### Insights:

- Trends over time indicate how values are changing for specific countries
- Distributions highlight patterns such as concentration or variability across countries
- Comparing countries reveals disparities or similarities in data for particular years
